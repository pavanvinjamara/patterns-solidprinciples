  SOLID PRINCIPLES
  ------------------
  This principles helps us to write code easier , clean , flexible ,to understand,  test and maintain

  S stands for Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  "One class ----> One Job"
  Why ?

  Because each operation has a different reason to change.
  Splitting improves maintainability, readabiltiy, testing and reduces
  side effects.

  Let us take an example we have UserService Class have multiple jobs
   1) Save User
   2) sendEmail
   3) generateReport

   Now this class changes if:
   DB changes ->(Sql to MongoDB)
   Email logic changes
   Report format changes



   O stands for Open/Closed Principle (ocp)
   "Open for extension closed for modification"

   Adding new Behaviour without rewriting the existing code.

      We should not make CameraService Class
      we make a CameraService interface we implement with brand classes



   L stands for Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP)
   "Child classes must behave like parent classes."


   I Stands for Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   "Don't force classes to implement things they don't use."

   D stands for Dependency Inversion Principle
